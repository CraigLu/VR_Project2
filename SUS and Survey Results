Participant 1: Kevin Sturn
Before:
1. I have a good understanding of using immersion effects to create a higher sense of presence in a virtual reality environment. (2)
2. I understand the trade off between performance and quality in a virtual experience. (3)

After:
1. I have a good understanding of using immersion effects to create a higher sense of presence in a virtual reality environment. (4)
2. I understand the trade off between performance and quality in a virtual experience. (5)


1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently. (2)
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex. (3)
3. I thought the system was easy to use. (3)
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. (3)
5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. (3)
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. (4)
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. (3)
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use. (3)
9. I felt very confident using the system. (2)
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. (3)

Total Score = 29
SUS Score = 2.5 * 29 = 72.5

Total Score = 34
SUS Score = 2.5 * 34 = 85

SUS:
Average SUS Score = (72.5 + 90 + 85) / 3 = 82.5
Our average SUS score is much greater than 68, which means we scored well above the average. 

Our Survey:
Average Increase of Agreement for Question 1:
((4-2) + (5-2) + (4-4)) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67

Average Increase of Agreement for Question 2:
((5-3) + (5-3) + (4-3)) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67

For question 1, you can see that on average the particpant was able to learn or have a better understanding of immersion 
effects creating a better sense of presence. By coincidence, question 2 had an equal increase in score. Thus, the participant's
understanding of the performance/quality trade off increased.
