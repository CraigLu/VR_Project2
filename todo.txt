todo:

Find something to tank framerate OR do it the right way with lowered sync (Just spawn and then delete a large high poly item)

Either Screen.setresolution (uncooperative, been fiddling) or
https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/20arg7/i_made_a_script_to_make_a_unity_camera_render/
(Not quite lower resolution but similar effect)

Background noise vs sourced noise

Background noise just attach it to the camera directly, otherwise just attach it to an objet (A child of the character, offset by some value)




Potential scary monster rushing
(http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/maya-dilophosaurus-frill/517654 ? Probably too high poly)
