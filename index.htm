      Our VR experience will show prospective students the various principles that Virtual Reality developers must keep in mind, by demonstrating these principles and how they can both improve and deteriorate the user’s experience. For example, we explore the give and take between performance and quality, showing how framerate is an important consideration to take into account by having the user experience low framerate.

          <p class="lead">
          User’s sense of presence is increased with the addition of assets like the water and the waterfall, environmental specific environments such as the bridge and the cherry blossom trees to give you a feel of a japanese environment. Another aspect that increases presence is the change of footstep audio as you walk on different surfaces (on the terrain, on the wooden bridge, and in the water). Using 3D audio is another factor for increase of presence, being able to hear the waterfall and the sound of birds from a specific direction has an effect on how the user experience these noises.

        <p class="lead">
        The scene was created with a terrain that has borders of mountains on all sides of the environment. These mountains not only act as colliders but also add to the background of the scene. Along with the mountains, the sky and the sunlight are other parts of the background that increase the sense of presence in the given environment. Once you’ve crossed the bridge, you can see a volcano off to your left in the distance. The volcano would be considered a part of the contextual geometry of the environment because it is a good reference point to where you are in the map even though it is located beyond the action space. In the environment, the fences, gates, lamps and the bridge are a part of the fundamental geometry. These objects have colliders on them to either keep you on a designated path (ie. the bridge) or to keep you out of a designated area (ie. the fences). Interactive objects are also a key part of the scene. The campfire is a great example of this because when the user is physcially close enough to the pit, a fire ignites. Audio also plays a huge role as it can add awareness as well as cue visual attention. Ambient sound effects can have more effect than one would think because they do a great job of increasing sense of realism and presence. Two good examples from our environment would be the birds chirping (sound increases as one approaches the trees) or the faint sound of the waterfall pouring down by the bridge. We also included spatialized audio in our sounds to act as a wayfinding aid as well as an effect to increase sense of position. Along with audio, having paths (ie. stones) and gates help the user find their way through the environment. All of these combined create a vitrual world in which you truly believe you are experiencing first hand.
